# Power BI Data Analysis Projects
This repository showcases two distinct Power BI projects, demonstrating data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation skills using different datasets and analytical approaches.

## Project 1: Titanic Data Analysis Dashboard (DAX Project)
This project focuses on analyzing the historical Titanic dataset, providing interactive visualizations and insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and the factors that influenced survival during the tragic event. This dashboard extensively utilizes DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations and custom measures.

Dataset
The primary dataset used for this analysis is titanic.csv. This file contains detailed information about individual passengers, including:

survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

sex: Gender

age: Age in years

sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard

parch: Number of parents/children aboard

fare: Passenger fare

embarked: Port of embarkation

class: Passenger class (categorical)

who: Man, Woman, Child

adult_male: Is the passenger an adult male?

deck: Deck number

embark_town: Town of embarkation

alive: Is the passenger alive?

alone: Is the passenger alone?

Key Features
Survival Rate Analysis: Investigate survival probabilities based on various attributes.

DAX-driven Insights: Custom measures and calculated columns built with DAX to derive deeper insights.

Interactive Filters: Explore data dynamically by passenger class, gender, age groups, and more.

## Project 2: Pakistan Map Dashboard
This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes data on a map of Pakistan, broken down by its subdivisions. It's designed to provide geographical insights and allow users to explore data related to different regions within Pakistan.

## Dataset
This project utilizes a "subdivision data set" .
## Key Features
Interactive Pakistan Map: Visualize data directly on a map of Pakistan, allowing drill-down into subdivisions.

Geographical Data Exploration: Understand regional variations and patterns.

Custom Map Visuals: Demonstrates the use of custom map visuals or advanced mapping techniques in Power BI.
